    <b>In the 35 years from 1929, when Gandhi chose Nehru as president of the Congress session at Lahore, 
     until his death, as prime minister, in 1964, Nehru remained—despite the debacle of the brief conflict
     with China in 1962—the idol of his people. His secular approach to politics contrasted with Gandhi 
     religious and traditionalist attitude, which during Gandhi's lifetime had given Indian politics a 
     religious cast—misleadingly so, for, although Gandhi may have appeared to be a religious conservative,
     he was actually a social nonconformist trying to secularize Hinduism. The real difference between 
     Nehru and Gandhi was not in their attitudes toward religion but in their attitudes toward civilization.
     Whereas Nehru talked in an increasingly modern idiom, Gandhi was harking back to the glories of ancient
     India.

   <b> On his return to India, Nehru at first had tried to settle down as a lawyer. Unlike his father, however, 
    he had only a desultory interest in his profession and did not relish either the practice of law or the
     company of lawyers. For that time he might be described, like many of his generation, as an instinctive
      nationalist who yearned for his country's freedom, but, like most of his contemporaries, he had not 
      formulated any precise ideas on how it could be achieved.</b>

  <b>Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses and tutors. Only one 
    of those—a part-Irish, part-Belgian theosophist, Ferdinand Brooks—appears to have made any impression on 
    him. Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor who taught him Hindi and Sanskrit. In 1905 he went to 
    Harrow, a leading English school, where he stayed for two years. Nehru’s academic career was in no way 
    outstanding. From Harrow he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years earning an 
    honours degree in natural science. On leaving Cambridge he qualified as a barrister after two years at 
    the Inner Temple, London, where in his own words he passed his examinations “with neither glory nor 
    ignominy.”<b></div>

  <b>At midnight on New Year's Eve 1929, Nehru hoisted the tricolour flag of India upon the banks of the Ravi in
  Lahore.<sup>[63]</sup>A pledge of independence was read out, which included a readiness to withhold taxes. The
  massive gathering of the public attending the ceremony was asked if they agreed with it, and the majority 
  of people were witnessed raising their hands in approval. 172 Indian members of central and provincial 
  legislatures resigned in support of the resolution and in accordance with Indian public sentiment. 
  The Congress asked the people of India to observe 26 January as Independence Day.<sup>[64]</sup> Congress volunteers,
  nationalists, and the public hoisted the flag of India publicly across India. Plans for mass civil 
  disobedience were also underway.<sup>[65]</sup></b>
